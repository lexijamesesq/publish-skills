# dotty-private's global CLAUDE.md. NOT meant to be executed directly (no
# shebang-driven behavior of its own) -- `source` it, then call
# resolve_references_key <key>. The one source of truth for this resolution:
# gate-mechanical.sh sources it for --rosters-path/--private-vocab-path, and
# playbooks/gate.md § Criteria 3's own documented hand-run qa.py example
# sources it too, so the two can never drift out of sync again (the prior
# duplicated, hand-typed form in gate.md is exactly what drifted).
#
# Prerequisite: `yq`, to parse the global CLAUDE.md's Configuration block.
# `yq` is Brewfile-declared -- its absence must fail loud, never
# silently degrade a resolved path to a caller's own broken pre-key default.
# Callers of this file are expected to `set -euo pipefail` themselves; this
# file only defines a function, it does not exit on its own when sourced.

# Resolve a references.* key from dotty-private's global CLAUDE.md — the
# single source of truth for where a declared file actually lives, never
# hardcoded here. Unlike a project CLAUDE.md (real YAML frontmatter, the
# shape statusline.sh's parse_declared_repos() reads), the global CLAUDE.md's
# Configuration block is a fenced ```yaml section in the body — extract that
# fence, not frontmatter. Empty output (missing file, missing key) is a
# legitimate "unresolved" signal, not an error — every caller falls back to
# its own consumer-side default for that case (qa.py's pre-key vault-relative
# default for rosters; an empty/unset --private-vocab-path, which qa.py
# itself already treats as a no-op). A missing `yq` is NOT one of those
# legitimate cases — call resolve_references_key_check_yq first and handle
# its failure explicitly (gate-mechanical.sh does this once, up front,
# ahead of every resolve_references_key call).
