  On-demand Mac-side configuration health check — makes each of the estate's
  local protection layers (a PreToolUse hook, the lint fixture suite, every
  hook a live settings.json registers, every hook a plugin serves in its
  place) prove it is wired RIGHT NOW, not that it was wired the day it
  shipped. Nine probes, grown by regression (two declared, operator-approved
  exceptions) — each one exists because a real silent-misconfiguration
  incident bit before it existed, or (probes 7 and 8) closes a coverage gap
  the ticket that added it named explicitly. Reports only;
  never fixes. Triggers on "/smoke", "run smoke", "smoke test the config",
  "check the hooks are wired".

# /smoke

Domain check for Mac-side configuration health. The estate's protection layers — hooks, the lint gate, registered automation — fail silently: a broken one doesn't error, it stops existing, and nothing distinguishes "this is fine" from "this stopped working three weeks ago" until the next incident proves it. `/smoke` is the check that would have caught each incident that motivated it, runnable again on demand.

## Identity

This skill owns ONE thing: proving nine specific local surfaces are wired correctly at the moment it runs. It does not scan for new problems, does not audit the whole harness, and does not fix anything it finds.

- **Mechanical only** — the bundled `smoke.sh` is the entire implementation: read-only, no network, no credentials, no writes. Every probe exercises the real surface (pipes real JSON at the real hook, runs the real fixture suite, parses the real live `settings.json`) — never a re-derivation from memory of what the surface *should* do.
- **Grows by regression, with two declared exceptions.** A probe is added only after a real silent-misconfiguration incident bites — except probes 7 and 8, each added not from an incident but from a coverage gap a HITL-approved ticket named explicitly when it required new wiring this skill needed to cover. Probe 7: probe 6 audits enablement for exactly one hardcoded plugin id, and nothing before probe 7 asserted the FULL declared-plugin set (every id the blueprint's `plugins.json` names) is enabled and installed, in every profile — that gap is the kind every other probe here exists to close after the fact, closed before the incident by the same estate substrate map ruling that mandated this skill's rework. Probe 8: the thin-layer rules/CLAUDE.md move's own spec named "`/smoke` gains one probe asserting the two files are real and declared" before the always-on rules and global CLAUDE.md moved off a live symlink/`@`-import onto declared state — the ticket that built the new surface is the map-ruled justification for the probe that proves it, the same footing probe 7 stands on. Both declared here as the growth rule's operator-approved exceptions, not a silent departure from it.

| Probe | Proves | Incident that added it |
|---|---|---|
| `hook-tilde-expansion` | `vault-mcp-redirect.sh` still expands a tilde-form `VAULT_ROOT` before the realpath comparison | 2026-06-02 — both vault-aware hooks compared a `realpath`-resolved absolute path against an *unexpanded* tilde in `VAULT_ROOT`, so the `case` match never fired; generic tools silently passed through unblocked on every vault `.md` file until caught |
| `lint-suite` | `lint.py`'s fixture suite still passes | a false-green fixture class plus a python-version drift that changed check behavior between machines — both surfaced only by re-running the suite, never by reading the script |
| `hook-registration-integrity` | every `.sh` hook a declared profile's `settings.json` registers still exists and is executable, with `hooks` the literal `{}` shape and no registration pointing under a deleted checkout path | a stale registered hook — an entry pointing at a path that had moved or lost its executable bit, invisible until the hook silently failed to fire |
| `core-symlink-integrity` | every per-entry symlink the core blueprint slice declares exists, is a symlink, and resolves to its declared target | 2026-07-18 — a dangling agents symlink persisted two months after its target was deleted, and `~/.git` pointed at a tree whose content sat one level down, producing 56 phantom deletions visible to any session under `$HOME` |
| `plugin-shadow-integrity` | no profile's own `skills/`/`agents/` directory has a live entry sharing a name with something an enabled, declared plugin already serves | 2026-09-03 — the prior form of this probe (`blueprint-coverage`) was self-referential (compared whichever skills tree it happened to run beside against `core.json`) and produced 36 false "undeclared" positives once probed from a location other than the source checkout; reworked to the correct post-cutover invariant, a live shadow silently winning over the plugin it shadows |
| `plugin-hook-serving-integrity` | when a profile's guards run from `estate-hooks@work-lifecycle` instead of `settings.json` directly, the plugin is enabled AND its installed cache still serves every hook the plugin declares | 2026-09-02 — a plugin-packaging spike found that enabling/disabling a Claude Code plugin only mutates `enabledPlugins` in `settings.json`; nothing audited it, so a silently disabled plugin would drop all nine guard hooks with zero visible signal |
| `plugin-enablement-integrity` | every plugin the blueprint's `plugins.json` declares, per profile, is enabled AND installed — generalizing probe 6's one-hardcoded-id check across the full declared set — plus, once, that both profiles' `plugins` link resolves to the same real directory outside any git working tree | declared exception, not an incident — see the growth-rule note above |
| `rules-claude-md-integrity` | both the always-on `ways-of-working.md` rule and the global `CLAUDE.md`, in both profiles, are real files (not a symlink or an `@`-import) whose content matches their declared source — the pinned dotty tag for the rule, dotty-private's own `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for the global file | declared exception, not an incident — the thin-layer move's own spec named this probe before the surface it checks existed; see the growth-rule note above |
| `plugin-marketplace-currency` | every marketplace this estate declares an `autoUpdate` value for (settings-declared `extraKnownMarketplaces`) resolves to that exact value in the live runtime registry (`known_marketplaces.json`) — the CLI's own highest-precedence gate for its background plugin auto-update pass — plus the `traffic-cone` PATH shim still points at the currently installed `work-lifecycle` | 2026-09-04 — LEX-694 postclose-e2e review: both Mini profiles served `work-lifecycle` 0.3.1 while 0.4.0 was already released, `/smoke` reported 8/8 against that two-versions-stale install, and no probe here asserted currency at all — only that whatever was installed was enabled and structurally wired |

Do not add a tenth probe without a new failure (or a map-ruled exception, declared here the way probes 7 and 8's are) to justify it.

## Intent

**Objective.** Without this skill, "did my hook/settings/lint change actually take" is answered by re-reading the diff and trusting it, at exactly the moment (right after editing config) when a silent break is most likely and least visible. `/smoke` replaces that ad hoc check with one deterministic pass, cheap enough to run habitually.

**Desired outcomes:**
1. Every infrastructure-touching session runs `/smoke` and trusts a clean run without manually re-deriving verification.
2. A regression in any of the protected surfaces is caught by the next `/smoke` run, not by the next incident.
3. The probe set stays exactly as large as real failures justify — no speculative coverage, no untested drift between what's probed and what's registered.

**Health metrics — must NOT degrade.**
- Zero writes, ever — `smoke.sh` reports; a fix path here would blur into the surfaces it's supposed to independently verify.
- Every probe fails loud on staleness before it evaluates health — a probe silently skipping because its target moved is worse than a probe that never existed.
- Exit code is the interface: 0 iff zero FAILs. No downstream consumer should need to parse prose.

**Strategic context.** The Pi side of the estate has Kuma heartbeats and maintenance-run gates watching its always-on processes; the Mac has no always-on process to host an equivalent. `/smoke` is the pull-based answer for the Mac specifically — verification the operator or session runs on demand, not push-based alerting.

**Constraints.**
- **Hard:** no writes, no network, no credential access. `smoke.sh` never fixes a finding.
- **Steering:** cadence is deliberately NOT scheduled. The Mac carries no wall-clock automation by estate ruling (unlike the Pi's cron-driven lanes), so invocation is an operator-initiated convention: run at session-start for any infrastructure-touching session, and after any infrastructure change (a hook edit, a `settings.json` edit, a `lint.py` change). Nothing enforces this — the discipline is the caller's.

**Decision authority.**
- **Autonomous:** running all nine probes; reporting PASS/FAIL per probe plus a summary line.
- **Escalate:** every FAIL — `/smoke` never remediates its own findings; the caller reads the detail and edits the broken surface directly.

**Stop rules.**
- `/smoke` only reports. It never edits a hook, a `settings.json`, or `lint.py` — the exit contract (0 iff zero FAILs) is the entire interface a caller needs.
- A probe's staleness check fails → that probe reports FAIL naming what moved. Never silently skip a probe whose target can't be found.

## Navigation

| Operation | Input | Output | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| **run** | none | One `PASS\|FAIL <probe-name>: <detail>` line per probe, then a summary line; exit 0 iff zero FAILs | `bash <skill-base-dir>/smoke.sh` |

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT fix anything it finds — report only, same discipline as `/lint-knowledge` and `/house-qa`.
- Does NOT run on any schedule or session boundary automatically — invocation is always explicit, per the cadence convention above.
- Does NOT replace `/lint-knowledge`'s periodic content-health pass — `lint-suite` here only proves the *test suite* still passes, not that the corpus itself is clean; run `/lint-knowledge` separately for that.
- Does NOT audit MCP servers or general plugin state — of the blueprint's plugin domain this skill checks only the three specific gaps probes 6, 7, and 9 close (a plugin silently disabled while a profile depends on it to serve hooks; the full declared-plugin set not enabled+installed per profile; the marketplace auto-update mechanism not actually armed despite being declared); everything else `/system-blueprint` governs stays `/system-blueprint`'s. The permanent, general-purpose audit for plugin state is a separate later effort — probes 6, 7, and 9 are the interim detectors.

- `~/bin/dotty-private/.claude/blueprint/plugins.json` — probes 5 and 7's declared-plugin-per-profile state; probe 5 also walks each declared plugin's installed cache (its `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `skills` field when present, else `skills/*`, plus `agents/*.md`) and each profile's own `skills/`/`agents/` dirs.
- `~/.claude-*/settings.json`, `~/.claude-*/plugins/installed_plugins.json`, and the resolved `estate-hooks@work-lifecycle` cache's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `hooks/hooks.json` — probe 6's targets.
- `~/.claude-*/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (every plugins.json-declared id) and `~/.claude-personal/plugins` / `~/.claude-professional/plugins` (the shared-cache symlink) — probe 7's targets.
- `~/bin/dotty-private/.claude/blueprint/ways-of-working.json` (the pin: tag, path, sha256), `~/bin/dotty-private/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (the declared global CLAUDE.md), `~/bin/dotty` (resolves the pinned tag's content), and `~/.claude-*/rules/ways-of-working.md` / `~/.claude-*/CLAUDE.md` (the installed files) — probe 8's targets.
- `~/.claude-*/settings.json` (`extraKnownMarketplaces`, the declared `autoUpdate` per marketplace), `~/.claude-*/plugins/known_marketplaces.json` (the live runtime registry probe 9 checks it against), and `~/.local/bin/traffic-cone` (the shim symlink, checked against `installed_plugins.json`'s `work-lifecycle@work-lifecycle` scope:user `installPath`) — probe 9's targets. Does NOT compare against the marketplace's highest release tag despite that being closer to a full currency check — the CLI's own marketplace clones are shallow with no tag refs, and a network fetch is out of this skill's no-network scope; see `smoke.sh`'s probe 9 header for the reasoning and the rejected local-HEAD alternative.
