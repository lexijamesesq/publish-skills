# Playbook: archive

Sweep eligible issue clusters — a topmost issue and every descendant beneath it — across the operator's teams (per Configuration), moving them out of the active Linear cap once every member has closed. Driven by the 2026-05-23 free-tier cap incident (250-ticket limit; project-attached issues bypass UI auto-archive — see the `/linear` SKILL.md discipline rules), and hardened into a topology-aware, cap-pressure-responsive design: archival respects the shape of the work — a cluster archives as a unit, never split — and the state of the cap — under pressure, the quiet-hold window dips progressively within the same run, sweeping again at each shorter hold until utilization clears or the floor is reached, so the sweep gets more aggressive exactly when it needs to.

## Input

```yaml
teams: [<team_prefix>, ...]  # default all teams in CLAUDE.md > Configuration — filter to subset if desired
dry_run: <bool>              # default depends on invocation context (see below)
today: <YYYY-MM-DD>          # orchestrator passes for testability — used for elapsed-time math against each cluster's newest `updatedAt`
```

There is no `grace_days` input. The hold period starts at a fixed 7-day (168-hour) quiet-hold baseline and, under cap pressure, dips iteratively within a single run (Protocol Step 6) — a caller-supplied grace period would fight the exact mechanism this design exists to provide.

**Dry-run default policy:**

| Invocation context | dry_run default |
|---|---|
| Operator ad-hoc (e.g., `/linear archive`) | `true` — never destroy data without explicit `--dry-run=false` |
| Automated / lane-triggered invocation | `false` — the invoking lane sets this explicitly; never inferred |

The default lives here in the playbook, not in the caller — that way ad-hoc invocations are safe regardless of caller carelessness. Per `live-test-vs-dry-run` operator-feedback memory.

**Invocable identically from either caller.** The operator's `/linear archive` and any automated lane-triggered invocation run the exact same Protocol below; only this `dry_run` default (and whatever the caller passes explicitly) differs.

## Protocol

1. **Resolve team scope.** Default to all teams in the operator's CLAUDE.md > Configuration. Translate the team prefix list to team UUIDs via the prefix→UUID mapping there. Never hardcode prefixes or UUIDs in this playbook — both are operator-specific and live in dotty-private (the abstraction must not contain the data it abstracts).

2. **Check initial cap pressure.** This check always covers every team in Configuration, regardless of the `teams` input filter from Step 1 — the 250-ticket cap is a workspace-wide constraint, not a per-team one, so a partial-team sweep still needs the true global count to size pressure correctly.

   The tactic MCP doesn't expose live per-team issue counts, so this is raw GraphQL: write the query payload (JSON with a `"query"` field) to a temp file, invoke the GraphQL bridge — the same authenticated bridge `claim.md`'s Step 6 uses for delegate-set, resolved via `secrets.op_read` / `linear.app_token_ref` (CLAUDE.md > Configuration; never a literal bridge or secret path in skill text — public repo) — and read the response.

   ```json
   {"query":"query { teams(filter: { id: { in: [\"<team-uuid-1>\", \"<team-uuid-2>\"] } }) { nodes { id key issueCount } } }"}
   ```

   Sum `issueCount` across every returned team → `active_issue_count`. This field excludes archived issues already, so it's the correct live-pressure signal — archiving a cluster moves this number directly. This same query is reissued after every archival pass in Step 6's dip loop, to recheck live pressure.

   **Baseline hold.** Every run's first pass sweeps at a fixed 7-day (168-hour) quiet hold, regardless of pre-run pressure.

   **Record for later use.** Record the pre-run `active_issue_count` for two later uses: sizing the dip loop (Step 6) and classifying the exit state (Step 7). If `active_issue_count` > 200, cap pressure is in effect — Step 6 handles the iterative dip.

3. **Fetch full topology.** Fetch every non-archived issue (open AND closed) across the resolved team scope — open issues are required to verify the all-closed eligibility invariant in Step 4; a topology built from closed issues alone can't tell a truly-orphaned-and-done cluster from one still anchored to an open sibling. Same GraphQL bridge as Step 2.

   ```json
   {"query":"query($after: String) { issues(first: 250, after: $after, filter: { team: { id: { in: [\"<team-uuid-1>\", \"<team-uuid-2>\"] } } }) { nodes { id identifier title parent { id } state { type } updatedAt team { key } } pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor } } }","variables":{"after":null}}
   ```

   The `issues` query excludes archived issues by default — exactly the live topology this pass needs. Loop while `pageInfo.hasNextPage` is true, feeding `endCursor` into `variables.after` on the next call. Given the 250-issue cap, this is typically one request, occasionally two.

   **This fetch happens once, at the start of the run.** The dip loop in Step 6 reuses this same topology across every pass, re-evaluating it at successively shorter hold levels rather than refetching — `updatedAt` values for issues untouched during the run don't change mid-pass. Clusters archived earlier in the same run are excluded from later passes by tracking their root ids (Step 6), not by re-querying.

   **If pagination fails partway through**, do not proceed on the partial set — an incomplete topology can misjudge the all-closed invariant (a member fetched on a page that never arrived looks absent, not open). Abort the pass, report what was fetched, and let the next run retry clean.

4. **Run the archive-sweep script.** Run `<skill-base-dir>/scripts/archive-sweep.py`, passing it the full topology response assembled in Step 3 (every page's `nodes` concatenated into one list, matching the script's expected `{"data":{"issues":{"nodes":[...]}}}` shape) via stdin or a file argument, plus the current hold level:

   ```
   python3 <skill-base-dir>/scripts/archive-sweep.py --hold-hours <H> [--now <today>] [--exclude-roots <root_id>,<root_id>,...] < topology.json
   ```

   The script rebuilds cluster topology and checks eligibility at hold `H`, then prints the candidate list as JSON to stdout. It is pure data processing — it never calls the Linear API. **If the script exits non-zero**, do not proceed on partial or guessed output — treat it like a pagination failure (see Failure modes): abort the pass, report the script's stderr, and let the next run retry against a fresh fetch.

   The canonical implementation is `scripts/archive-sweep.py` — this playbook does not maintain a second copy of the algorithm.

   **Candidate output** (one entry per eligible cluster, not per issue):

   ```json
   {
     "total_issues": <int>,
     "total_clusters": <int>,
     "hold_hours": <float>,
     "candidates": [
       {
         "root_id": "<uuid>",
         "root_identifier": "<TEAM>-N",
         "root_title": "<string>",
         "root_team": "<team_prefix>",
         "cluster_size": <int>,
         "member_identifiers": ["<TEAM>-N", ...],
         "newest_updated_at": "<ISO datetime>",
         "hours_since_newest_update": <float>,
         "hold_hours_applied": <float>
       }
     ],
     "ineligible_summary": { "has_open_member": <int>, "within_hold": <int> }
   }
   ```

   `root_id` is the field the dip loop (Step 6) accumulates into `--exclude-roots` across passes. `total_clusters` maps to this playbook's `clusters_evaluated` output field — constant across every pass in a run, since the topology itself doesn't change mid-run.

5. **If `dry_run: true`:** run the script (Step 4) once, at the 168-hour baseline hold, with no `--exclude-roots`, and return its candidate list with summary counts, the pre-run `active_issue_count`, and whether that count exceeds 200. Do NOT call archive, and do NOT run Step 6's recount/dip loop — dipping is a live response to a live recount, and a dry run never archives, so there is nothing to recount. If pre-run pressure exceeds 200, note in the output that a live run would engage the iterative dip loop beyond this baseline preview. Output ends here.

6. **If `dry_run: false`:** run the sweep as an iterative loop, starting at the 168-hour baseline hold:

   a. **Sweep at the current hold.** Re-invoke the script (Step 4) at the current hold level, passing `--hold-hours` for that level and `--exclude-roots` carrying every root id archived in an earlier pass this run (empty on the first pass). For each candidate the script returns, archive the root only via `mcp__linear-tactic__linear_archiveIssue` — cascade handles descendants; never issue a child-level archive call. Add each archived root's `root_id` to the running `--exclude-roots` set for the next pass. Record this pass (hold level, candidates found, roots archived) for the output's `passes` list.

      **Recoverable.** Linear's archive is recoverable — archived issues remain in the database, just outside the active cap. If a sweep archives a cluster prematurely, it can be unarchived via `linear_unarchive*` operations (out of scope for this playbook; operator does it manually).

   b. **No pre-run pressure? Stop.** If the pre-run `active_issue_count` (Step 2) was ≤ 200, stop after this one pass — there was no pressure to respond to. Exit state: `normal`.

   c. **Otherwise, recount.** Reissue Step 2's `teams { issueCount }` query to get the live `active_issue_count` after this pass's archival.

   d. **Cleared? Stop.** If `active_issue_count` ≤ 200, stop. Exit state: `cap_pressure`.

   e. **Still over, and hold above the floor? Dip and repeat.** If `active_issue_count` > 200 and the current hold is above 12 hours, halve it (168 → 84 → 42 → 21 → 12, never below 12) and return to (a) — re-invoking the script at the halved `--hold-hours` with the accumulated `--exclude-roots`.

   f. **Still over, and already at the floor? One last pass, then stop.** If `active_issue_count` > 200 and the hold is already at 12 hours: if pass (a) at the floor found and archived at least one candidate, recount once more via (c) — a further floor pass in the same run will find zero new candidates from the script, since no time passes mid-run, so this converges immediately. If pass (a) at the floor found zero candidates, stop. Exit state: `exhausted`.

   The halving progression is fixed and bounded: 168h → 84h → 42h → 21h → 12h. At most 5 sweep passes (1 baseline + up to 4 dips) run per invocation, each one a fresh script invocation — the loop cannot run indefinitely.

7. **Classify the pass's exit state**, using the pre-run `active_issue_count` (Step 2) and the outcome of Step 6's loop:
   - **`normal`** — pre-run `active_issue_count` ≤ 200. No pressure; the run took its one pass at the 168-hour baseline and stopped.
   - **`cap_pressure`** — pre-run `active_issue_count` > 200, and the dip loop brought utilization to ≤ 200 by the end of the run (at the baseline hold or after one or more dips). The dipped hold did its job.
   - **`exhausted`** — pre-run `active_issue_count` > 200, the hold reached the 12-hour floor, and the final recount is still > 200. Maximum aggression already applied; nothing further is eligible right now. This is an accepted residual — the workspace stays over 200 until more clusters close and age past 12 hours, and the next run picks it up.

   **All three states exit successfully.** None of them is a failure, and none escalates to the operator beyond ambient dead-man monitoring (the lane simply not having run) — autonomous cap management means the sweep handles its own pressure without a human in the loop. A partial pass ending in `cap_pressure` or `exhausted` is expected behavior, not a problem to surface.

8. **Handle failures.** If any cluster-root archive call fails (rate limit, transient API, permission), continue with the rest — one bad root doesn't stop the pass. Collect all failures; report together.

```

## Failure modes to surface clearly

- **GraphQL bridge failure (cap check or topology fetch).** Neither Step 2 nor Step 3 has a fallback — both are required inputs to eligibility and pressure sizing. Abort the pass, report the failure, retry on the next run.
- **Recount failure mid-loop (Step 6c).** If a recount call fails partway through the dip loop, do not guess at the live count to decide whether to keep dipping — stop the loop where it stands, report everything archived so far plus the failure, and let the next run pick up from the (now-lower, but unconfirmed) count.
- **Partial pagination on the topology fetch.** Do not compute eligibility from an incomplete issue set — abort rather than risk a false-positive all-closed read. Report what was fetched; the next run retries clean.
- **Linear API rate limit on cluster-root archive calls.** Pause + report partial completion; operator can re-invoke, or the next scheduled run picks up the remainder.
- **Network failure mid-batch (archive calls).** Report which roots succeeded; un-archived candidates remain eligible for the next sweep (their hold period has already passed, so they stay candidates).
- **Permission failure on a specific root.** Skip + report; don't abort the batch.

## What this playbook does NOT do

- Does NOT gate eligibility on relations — cluster-membership-and-quiet-hold only. A `blocked_by` or other relation edge touching a cluster member never excludes it; when either endpoint of a relation archives, Linear archives the relation edge with it as an accepted side effect.
- Does NOT check per-issue `[VALIDATION]` comments. Validation enforcement lives at close time (traffic-cone's fused `mark_done` script refuses without a verdict); at cluster granularity, an unvalidated Done ticket buried inside an otherwise-eligible cluster isn't a distinct signal worth carrying forward from the old per-issue design.
- Does NOT respect Linear UI's auto-archive setting (the whole point — that setting doesn't work for project-attached issues, which is why this playbook exists).
- Does NOT change the cap. Free tier is 250; this maintains headroom *within* the cap.
